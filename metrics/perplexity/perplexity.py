_CITATION = """\

"""

_DESCRIPTION = """
Perplexity (PPL) is one of the most common metrics for evaluating language models.
It is defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of a sequence, calculated with exponent base `e`.

For more information, see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Perplexity can be calculated by passing in a set of logits, labels, and attention mask tensors to the `compute()` function.
To run inference and calculate perplexities with a pretrained model, use the measurement version of this metric instead.
Args for `compute`:
    logits (`ndarray`): Tensor-like, of shape [batch size, sequence length, vocab size]
    labels (`ndarray`): Tensor-like, of shape [batch, sequence length]
    attention_mask (`ndarray`): Tensor-like, of shape [batch, sequence length]
Returns:
    perplexity: dictionary containing the perplexity scores for the texts
        in the input list, as well as the mean perplexity. If one of the input texts is
        longer than the max input length of the model, then it is truncated to the
        max length for the perplexity computation.
